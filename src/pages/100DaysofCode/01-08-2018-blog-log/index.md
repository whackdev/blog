## 100 Days of Code Challenge
### Day 8 of 100

#### Coding Log
Yesterday before starting on my coding pursuits for the day I was reading my daily Medium digest and an article came up about [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). The article discussed using Gatsby as a React powered single page generator to create a blog. When I started with FreeCodeCamp (FCC) I read from many users that bloggin about your learnings and/or making tutorials really reinforces the material. While I always thought about doing those things I never seemed to find the time needed to do so. 
This may just be the article for me!
I went through the tutorial but unfortunately it was poorly written and I gave it up as a bad job because I didn't want this to sidetrack me from my normal projects to keep going on this challenge. This morning however the concept was still vexing me. How awesome would it be to type up a quick Markdown file and its turns itself into a post with built in routing! I decided to give it another go, and went back to the interwebs looking for the answers. I found out the tutorial I went through in the FCC section of Medium was a learner like myself and they had followed an older better written tutorial. I went through this and was able to get it to work. 
This blog will now serve as my coding log and I will go back and re-capture my coding efforts through the previous week, and keep as current as possible going forward. This initial verision is very basic and needs more styling and features that I intend on building out in due course as well as hosting my personal coding portfolio.

###### TO-DOs
* There are some things to think about for future coding:
  * Should my portfolio be hosted w/ surge?
  * GraphQL Tutorial
  * MD Tutorial
* Blog
  * Features
    * Nav
    * Landing Page
    * Dedicated 100 Days of Code Page
    * Dedicated Blog Posts Page
    * Link to `/log`  blog posts from `/100DaysofCode`.
  * Better styling

###### Takeaways
The hardest part of today was GraphQL as I have never encountered it before. I still don't fully understand all it is doing under the hood. Depending on my current projects and where the next days of coding take me I will have to investigate this in the future.
