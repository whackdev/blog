## 100 Days of Code Challenge
### Day 1 of 100

#### Coding log
Today I started the [100 Days of Code](http://100daysofcode.com/) challenge. I am going to write a later post on the why for that, actually I'm writing this from the future (more details in following posts)! Jumping back to the present, to start the challenge I decided to complete one of the React challenges I hadn't finished called the [FCC Leaderboard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard). I had started this challenge when I first discovered [React](www.reactjs.org) and thought it would help me learn.  
It turns out that while I felt very comfortable with JavaScript these React challenges were way above my head, particularly in integrating in [Codepen](https://codepen.io). I tried googling a bunch of things about using both tools together and made some progress but kept hitting walls and my project was only showing a white screen.

I decided to take a course on React, it wasn't free like my previous resources but I like React a lot. I love the concept of JS being used for the UI because that is what I am most comfortable with. I am far from completeing the full course at about halfway done but I have completed the initial application creation process.

With that knowledge and starting my challenge today I used Create-React-App to create a React project and then had it complete the following user stories: 

1. User Story: I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

2. User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

3. User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

I ejected from Create-React-App to take advantage of CSS Module as I learned in my course and deployed it to Heroku. I was so hooked I stayed up until 1:30 am to finish!
