### 100 Days of Code

I am an aspiring self-taught full stack developer. I originally discovered Python and started my dive into coding with that language.
As I went through I was struggling to find decent resources to aid in my pursuits. While searching for resources I came across [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). FCC was a game changer for me as the materials were very well done and plentiful. I quickly worked through many of the challenges after getting used to JS syntax (which is very similiar to Python btw), and never looked back. I have completed all of the backend and algorithm challenges, and am knocking off the other challenges when I can.

This led me to hearing about the 100 Days of Code challenge, and as I was reaching the close of 2017 I decided to re-engage with my coding development by participating in this challenge. You see even though I love coding, I am married with two kids and have a full-time job in the insurance industry. All of these obligations take precedent over coding because we have to pay the bills and raise our kids and it was easy for me to think "I'm too tired to figure that out right now..." or "If I have to read another document...". I decided that this challenge was exactly what I needed to gain the traction I felt slipping away AND remind me that anything worth having takes effort.

### The Challenge

The challenge stipulates that you will spend at least 1 hour for 100 consecutive days CODING. I felt for a long time that hanging around in the FCC chatrooms was the same thing, but no longer. I love the idea of helping other devs especially if they are learning on their own like I am trying to, but I think to really get coding you need to actively use the skills very similiar to learnign a new spoken language. The best way for me to do this is coding on real life projects, whether a problem of my own, completing a course, or completing an uncompleted challenge at FCC.

This blog will serve as my coding log through the challenge and likely turn into my personal code blog to share my projects and learnings with others.

##### Happy Hacking!
